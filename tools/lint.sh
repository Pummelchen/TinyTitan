# Opting out of the converter check: `ALLOW_MISSING_CONVERTER_DEPS=1`. The gate

# --- unbounded whole-file reads ---------------------------------------------
# A metadata document read by `Data(contentsOf:)` or `String(contentsOf:)`
# materializes the whole file before anything looks at it, so a bound applied to
# the bytes afterwards is a bound applied after the cost. Measured here: a 2 GiB
# sparse file (0 B allocated on disk, so the read is pure allocation) took 0.350 s
# and raised the process footprint by 2,049 MB on a 24 GB Mac — enough to page a
# resident model out mid-generation. The nine load-path sites that had that shape
# now read through `BoundedMetadataRead` (engine) or `Posix.readBoundedData`
# (converter), which `fstat` the descriptor being read and refuse before
# allocating.
#
# This gate keeps that from regressing: every whole-file read under `sources/`
# needs an audited reason. Opting out: `lint:allow-unbounded-read <reason>` in the
# comment block directly above, where the reason names the bound the input already
# carries — a range this process itself requested, a resource the package ships, an
# operator-named file outside every trust boundary, or an mmap that is the point of
# the read.
#
# The call is found by joining each line with its continuations, not by matching
# one line: `swift-format` wraps a long argument list, and a line-oriented grep
# reported `ok` over `Data(\n    contentsOf: …)` -- which is exactly how one of the
# nine reads AUD-142 bounded survived it. A gate that cannot see its own input
# reads as a pass over code it never looked at, the failure this file already
# refuses for `func-length` by printing UNRESOLVED instead of shrugging.

# --- production file length -------------------------------------------------
# `AGENTS.md` states the standard: a file under `sources/` stays at 500 physical
# lines or fewer, comments and blanks included, and an oversized file is split
# along a cohesive seam as pure code motion with the public API preserved.
# `tests/` is deliberately not covered — it is organised by the suite each file
# covers, so a test file over the number is a readability question rather than a
# gate finding. `.metal` shader sources are not covered either: one kernel file
# is one compiled artifact per pass family, so cutting `prefill.metal` (1,377
# lines) at 500 would move a kernel between files without making either easier
# to read. The rule as written says "a file under `sources/`", which is wider
# than that; where the scope is narrower than the prose, the prose is the thing
# to amend, and this comment is where the difference is stated rather than
# hidden.
#
# What the gate is for: the standard was carried by habit alone, and habit lost.
# Measured 2026-10-06, three files were over it (529, 521 and 519) and had been
# for a week after the layout doc last claimed none were; this sweep's own
# AUD-142 commit added 4 lines to one of them and 7 to another, and neither the
# compiler nor any of the other thirteen gates objected. A number nobody checks is
# a suggestion.
#
# There is no opt-out and no baseline file on purpose. func-length ratchets
# because 1,449-line functions cannot all be decomposed in one pass; a 501-line
# file can be split in one, so an exemption row would only be a way to leave one
# behind. `MAX_FILE_LINES` exists so the number is stated in one place.

# --- converter: expert placement ---------------------------------------------
# A routed-expert checkpoint may ship experts one tensor at a time, and the
# converter stacks them into the fused axis the repacker packs. The experts
# arrive in whatever order the shards and the (lexicographic) index put them --
# KAT's arrive 0, 1, 10, 100, ... -- so filing them by arrival order puts expert
# k's weights in expert j's slot. Everything downstream still passes: the bytes
# match the checkpoint, the shapes are right, `validateRoleUniformity` passes,
# the receipt verifies, and the model answers fluently from the wrong experts.
# It has to be caught here, because no Swift test can see a converter bug.
#
# Fails closed. The probe imports `numpy` and the converter module, so a machine
# without them used to print "SKIP: ... (converter deps unavailable)" and exit 0
# — which is the exact shape of the defect this gate hunts: everything reads
# green while nothing was checked. Missing dependencies now name the install
# command, the way the javascript gate names `npm ci`.
#
# Opting out: `ALLOW_MISSING_CONVERTER_DEPS=1 tools/lint.sh` for a run that
# cannot install them (a machine with no numpy for the width this check needs).
# The skip is then printed as a skip, loudly, and is the only case in which this
# gate goes quiet without running the probe.

# stops being its own". `TinyTitanLib` itself has never held a `print`, so the
# letter of the rule was met -- and the purpose was not: the diagnostics the
# engine writes under `TINYTITAN_LAYER_TRACE` and `TURBO_FIELDFARE_PHASES` went
# to stdout from `TinyTitan`, which every library call runs through. An
# embedder that turned one on got trace lines interleaved with its own answers.
#
# The scope is therefore the closure the manifest gives the library, not the
# library directory: `library-facade-rules.py` already enforces rule 1 over
# `sources/TinyTitanLib/` alone, and nothing reached past it. The closure is read
# from `Package.swift` rather than listed here, so a new dependency enters the
# gate on the same commit it enters the library -- and a gate that walked no
# target reports a failure instead of a pass.
# Front ends keep their own stdout: measured on the tree as it stands, 91
# `print`/`debugPrint`/`standardOutput` lines in 14 files, every one in an
# executable outside the closure (the CLI and server `Command`/main entries, the
# bench driver, the installer's progress, the memory tool, the fleet manager, the
# continuity demo). The scan is Swift-only; the one C target in the closure has
# no stdout write today, measured by the same grep (`printf`/`fputs`/`stdout`
# across `sources/TinyTitanKernelsC` finds nothing).

#   * bash-4 expansions and builtins (`${v^^}`, `mapfile`), which 3.2 parses and

#     accepts it, so it is invisible on a development machine. Write it

# --- test-hollow -------------------------------------------------------------
# A @Test body with no assertion, no `try` and no call into an asserting helper
# cannot fail, whatever the code under test does. The audit found three of these
# (AUD-128): a body whose only statement was `_ = (aFunction, "a string")`, a
# comment that conceded "Documentation-only", and two runners built and then
# discarded so the test asserted only that construction did not throw. Each
# recorded coverage that did not exist, which is the same injury as a silent
# skip with a harder edge: it is invisible even in a green run's line-by-line log.
#
# `try` counts as an assertion because Swift Testing fails the test when the body
# throws, so the "this accepted" bodies the repo already has pass the gate on
# purpose. The rule is:
#   assertion token -> fine
#   `try`           -> fine (a throw fails the test)
#   calls a helper whose body asserts, directly or through another helper -> fine
#   none of those   -> hollow
# Comments and string literals are blanked before the scan, so a `#expect` inside
# a doc comment is not an assertion, and brace matching cannot be thrown off by a

# --- library facade ----------------------------------------------------------
# `AGENTS.md`'s "Two products, one repository" makes three promises about
# `sources/TinyTitanLib/`, the surface an embedder depends on: `public` there is
# deliberate ("nothing becomes `public` by accident", rule 3), the library
# "imports no NIO" and keeps stdout clean (rule 1). Measured 2026-10-06 all
# three held and none of them was enforced anywhere: `tools/lint.sh` had
# fifteen checks and not one of them looked at access level, imports or stdout
# in that target, and swiftlint's committed config has no such rule either. An
# unenforced promise is a reviewer's memory, and the day a fifth front end
# needs one more `public` type nobody will notice the surface has stopped being
# a surface.
#
# The public surface is a ratchet over a committed allowlist, compared as a
# multiset rather than a set of keys: `Session.respond` has two overloads, and
# `sort -u` would let one of them vanish while its row stayed "earned". `open`
# counts as surface too -- it promises more than `public`, because it also
# allows overriding outside the module -- and leading attributes are stripped
# before the modifier is tested, so `@discardableResult public func` cannot hide
# from a scanner that only looks at what a line starts with. The two absolute
# rules have no baseline and no opt-out, because there is nothing to ratchet --
# the correct count is zero.
#
# A missing allowlist is a failure, not a fresh baseline. func-length may write
# its own because an over-long function is already known and counted; here an
# absent file means the audited list is gone, and blessing whatever is in the
# tree is the exact accident the check exists to catch. Regenerate deliberately
# with `FACADE_UPDATE=1 tools/lint.sh library-facade`.

# --- documented facts --------------------------------------------------------
# A fact the repository can compute and a document restates is a defect waiting
# for the next commit that changes the computation. Measured 2026-10-06: the gate
# count was written down in four documents and derived in none, so all four
# disagreed with the script -- `AGENTS.md` thirteen, `CONTRIBUTING.md` eleven, the
# handover and `RELEASE.md` both fifteen -- four mode names in the usage header
# were not runnable at all, and the release brief cited three tag-object shas
# where every consumer of a sha needs the tagged commit.
#
# `tools/docs-facts.py` derives the gate set from this script's own `all` chain,
# `case` arms, usage header and unknown-check message -- they must agree with each
# other before any document is judged -- then compares every tracked Markdown
# and workflow YAML against it. This audit's own ledger prose is excluded on
# purpose: it quotes wrong numbers and shas verbatim as the thing it later refutes,
# and it is corrected forward, so failing on a quotation would demand an edit to the
# record instead of an addition to it. The boundary is prose versus reference — the
# ledger's structured `commit` field is not a quotation, it is the pointer a reader
# follows to check a fix, and `ledger_commit_evidence` does judge it (AUD-209).
