# --- function length --------------------------------------------------------
# Indentation-anchored: a function runs from its `func` line to the first line
# that closes a brace at the same indent. Brace-depth counting drifts on braces
# inside strings and comments; this codebase is consistently formatted, so
# indent is the more reliable anchor.
#
# Every `func` must land in exactly one of three buckets: no body (a protocol
# requirement), a body that opens and closes on one line, or a body with a
# closer at its own indent. Anything else is printed as UNRESOLVED and fails
# the check. A gate that silently skips what it cannot parse reports "ok" for
# code it never looked at, which is worse than no gate — so unparsed input is
# an error, not a shrug.
