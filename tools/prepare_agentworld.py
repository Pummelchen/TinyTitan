"""Convert a Qwen3.5-MoE 35B-A3B release (Qwen-AgentWorld, Qwen3.6) from its
bf16 checkpoint into the affine 4-bit or 8-bit snapshot TinyTitanRepack installs.

AgentWorld's text model is the Qwen3.5-MoE 35B-A3B geometry this runtime
already runs as the `qwen36` family (2048 hidden, 40 layers, 256 experts at
top-8, gated-DeltaNet with full attention every fourth layer). What differs
is the source: Qwen ships it as bf16 under the vision wrapper's tensor names,
with the routed experts fused per layer. So this is prepare_qwen38.py's job
-- fetch one shard at a time, quantize, write MLX-shaped output, delete the
shard -- with this family's renames and slot policy, and without Qwen3.8's
n-gram table, PLE constants and indexer.

Disk footprint while running: two source shards (~7 GB) plus the output
(about 19.5 GB at 4-bit, 37.8 GB at 8-bit). The install TinyTitanRepack writes
afterwards is a second copy of the output.

    python3.13 tools/prepare_agentworld.py --plan            # no download
    python3.13 tools/prepare_agentworld.py --bits 4 \\
        --output .build/agentworld-affine-4bit --work .build/agentworld-shards
    python3.13 tools/prepare_agentworld.py --bits 4 8 \\
        --output .build/agentworld-affine --work .build/agentworld-shards
        # one download, two snapshots: <output>-4bit and <output>-8bit

Kept at the checkpoint's own bf16 in both widths -- "low-cost data at
16-bit where it helps": the router and the scalar shared-expert gate (they
produce decisions, and a decision either matches the reference or it does
not), the GDN a/b projections (the smallest projections, where a 64-wide
group has the least to amortise over), and every norm, conv tap, A_log and
dt_bias. Together about 45 MB of resident memory. The runtime reads these
tensors' width from their own dtype, which is what the Qwen3.8 8-bit build
established.

    what the runtime's expert streaming reads. Without it the experts are

    **Each expert is placed at its own index, never appended.** A fused source
    supplies the whole axis in one tensor, and for a per-expert source the
    tensors arrive in whatever order the shards happen to hold them -- KAT's
    layer-0 experts are spread across shards, so ascending arrival is not
    guaranteed. Appending would put expert *k*'s weights in expert *j*'s slot:
    every byte still matches the checkpoint, the shapes and the manifest are
    right, `validateRoleUniformity` passes, and the model then routes to one
    expert while reading another's weights -- fluent, partly-informed nonsense
    that no downstream check can see. The ordering is therefore asserted, not
    assumed.

    Only one layer's tensors are held: `release` drops an entry as soon as its
    last expert lands, so the peak is one layer's three projections (about
    1.5 GiB at 4-bit) plus the writer's open block.
