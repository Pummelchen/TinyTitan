# Repack the dense Qwen 3.5 models as .ssdai installs, and prove the result.
#
# The three (six, with 8-bit) small Qwen 3.5 models were the only installs in
# this project that were affine safetensors snapshots rather than .ssdai
# directories. They are .ssdai now, built from the converted snapshot, so the
# whole pipeline is one shape: convert -> repack -> receipt -> verify-install.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/repack_dense.sh <2b|4b|9b|all> [4|8|both]
#
# What it does for each model, in this order and stopping at the first failure:
#
#   1. move the existing snapshot out of models/ and into .build/, which is
#      where the converter stages every other family too (see the ornith MTP
#      row in install_models.sh). It cannot stay in models/: the catalog scans
#      that directory, so a snapshot left beside its install is probed as a
#      second model and reported as a duplicate id;
#   2. repack .build/<key>-affine -> models/<dir>, which writes the receipt
#      bound to that final path -- a receipt is path-bound, so the install has
#      to be written where it will live, never moved into place afterwards;
#   3. byte-diff the residents against the snapshot with
#      tools/ssdai_diff_snapshot.py -- a repack is a byte copy, so this is an
#      exact comparison and not a tolerance;
#   4. re-issue and check the receipt (TinyTitanRepack --verify-install);
#   5. run the CPU equivalence gate, which loads both and requires identical
#      logits (tests/TinyTitan/CPUEngine/DenseSSDAIEquivalenceTests.swift).
#
# Step 5 is the one that matters. Steps 3 and 4 prove the bytes are right and
# the receipt is right; only step 5 proves the reader interprets them right, and
# a wrong per-tensor width would pass both of the others.
