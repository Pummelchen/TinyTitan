#
# `tools/release.sh` and `tools/build_library.sh` both need it, and both shipped
# the same line for it: a `grep -qE ... && die` over the build log. grep answers
# with three different statuses -- 0 found a warning, 1 found none, 2 could not
# read the file -- and that shape can only act on 0, so a log that was missing,
# empty, unreadable or truncated left `die` unreached and the script carried on to
# stage and publish. AUD-266.
#
# Three verdicts, three answers. "This log holds no warning", "this log records no
# finished build" and "I cannot read this log" are different findings, and only the
# first may be a pass. The completion marker is what separates a log that holds a
# build from one that holds a fragment: every real build log on the machine this was
# measured on (the six release logs and the library logs beside them, eleven files)
# is plain text carrying at least one line that starts `Build complete!`.
#
# Deliberately not changed here: the pattern's extension set, which is exactly the
# set this package compiles (no `.cpp`, `.cc`, `.cxx` or `.S` under `sources/`).
# Widening it to every line that contains `warning:` would refuse the three most
# recent releases, each of whose logs carries SwiftPM's own
# `warning: 'swift-nio': skipping cache due to an error:` -- a build-management
# message, not a diagnostic -- so whether a release should stop on one is a
# decision, not a fix.

# The diagnostics a compiler prints as `file:line:col: warning: `. Single-sourced:
