"""Full-stack parity for Qwen3.8-Flash-Next at position 0.

Runs all 48 layers in numpy from the installed weights and compares the wide
residual at every layer entry against what the runtime dumped. Position 0 is
chosen because every carried state -- the KV cache, the delta-rule state, the
two convolution histories -- is empty there, so the whole stack reduces to
closed-form algebra and a divergence is unambiguously a bug in one layer's
math rather than in state threading.

Usage:  python3 tools/qwen38_full_forward.py <model-dir> <dump-dir>

Exit status: 0 every layer entry and the stack output agreed, 1 something
diverged, 2 a dump file was missing and nothing was compared.
