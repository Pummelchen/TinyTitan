"""Export the ANE prefill attention sidecar for a `.ssdai` model.

Produces `<model>/ane_prefill/layer_<L>.mlpackage` for every full-attention
layer: a multifunction Core ML program whose functions `h0, h4096, ...` share
one set of fp16 weights (dequantized from the model's int4 affine tensors)
and differ only in how much KV history they attend to. Chunk width is fixed
at 4096 — the production prefill chunk — with the causal mask and NeoX RoPE
tables built in-graph, so the Swift runtime feeds only the normed hidden
chunk and the token-major fp16 K/V history.

Why these choices (all measured, see docs/v4.4-decode-width-plan.md Track A):
- decomposed attention, never the fused SDPA op — the fused op produces
  NaN/inf on this M3's ANE from sequence length 2048;
- fp16 weights — they amortize over 4,096-token chunks, so quantized palettes
  buy nothing at prefill; the sidecar is ~52 MB per layer;
- fixed enumerated shapes — chunk boundaries in this runtime are always
  multiples of 4096, so history is too, and fixed shapes keep the ANE
  scheduler on the fast path;
- additive -30000 mask instead of -inf — exp() underflows identically and
  fp16 infinity arithmetic stays out of the graph. The mask is an *input*, so
  a family whose attention selects keys (Qwen 3.8's QSA indexer) is served by
  the runtime folding that selection into the same additive mask; the graph
  itself is identical, and `selectionFolded` in the metadata records that the
  sidecar was exported knowing this.

  ~/.venvs/coreml-py311/bin/python tools/export_ane_prefill.py \
      --model models/ornith-1.5_35B_A3B_4Bit --max-history 12288

Exits non-zero, writes nothing, and leaves any existing sidecar untouched when
the Neural Engine refuses to compile a variant. Core ML reports that failure on
the native stderr and otherwise exits 0, so without this an export could
"succeed" into a sidecar that the runtime then runs on the CPU at ~38x the GPU
prefill cost (issue #7). A successful export records `aneCompileVerified` in
`ane_prefill.json`, and the runtime refuses a sidecar that lacks it.

Compiling is not the last word either: every function the metadata records is
also *loaded* under its `h<history>` name before the export commits, because a
specialization the ANE refuses can still save and then fail at the runtime's
`MLModel(contentsOf:)` — which would advertise coverage the sidecar cannot
serve. Qwen 3.8's `h12288` is that case on this machine.
