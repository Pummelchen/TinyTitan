# The golden baseline is the only check that exercises real inference.
#
# VERIFICATION USES ONLY THE MODELS ALREADY INSTALLED UNDER models/. That
# directory is deliberately kept below the full supported set to save disk, so a
# target with no install is *reported as not checked* -- here and in the release
# notes -- and is never resolved by downloading, converting, repacking or
# re-installing a model. Nothing in this script fetches a model, and the guard
# below re-checks that the golden phase left models/ exactly as it found it.
#
# A baseline the host can see but cannot *read* is a different case and stays a
# documented exception with a mandatory reason. 5.3 was cut on a machine where
# Dropbox had left seven installs online-only and the disk could not hold the
# 134 GB the largest one needed to materialize: every expert read failed, which
# this phase reports as `mismatch (4)` and which has nothing to do with the
# runtime. Deleting a target from the list below would hide that from every
# future reader of this file, so the skip is explicit, carries a reason, prints
# it beside the skip, and must be repeated in the release notes -- --publish

TinyTitan $VERSION — prebuilt binaries (macOS, Apple Silicon / arm64)

Built from tag $TAG with: swift build -c release
Requires macOS 26+. Apple Silicon only; there is no x86_64 build.

Contents
  TinyTitanServer          OpenAI-compatible local server (binds 127.0.0.1 only)
  TinyTitanCLI             one-shot prompt CLI
  TinyTitanRepack          model installer / repacker
  TinyTitanBench           benchmark driver
  *.bundle             Metal shader library and other runtime resources — keep
                       these next to the executables or the runtime cannot
                       load its kernels

  NOTICE               copyright and upstream attribution
  THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md

These binaries are NOT code-signed or notarized. macOS Gatekeeper will refuse
them on first run. Either build from source, or clear the quarantine attribute
yourself after verifying the checksum published with this archive:

  xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /path/to/tinytitan-$VERSION-macos-arm64

No model weights are included. TinyTitanRepack defaults to Ornith 1.5 8-bit (about
36.9 GB); 4-bit remains available explicitly. The runtime defaults to standard
answers with thinking off, as described in the README and Wiki.

  # of why each change exists and how it was verified.
  #
  # Two reasons this is a build step rather than a request to the author:
  # compaction is mechanical (re-lay-out, never reword), so it should not depend
  # on remembering; and every string the greps above rely on is passed back in as
  # --require, so a compaction that would drop an unchecked baseline fails HERE,
  # before the Release exists, rather than publishing one that is quietly
  # missing a target.
  #
  # The character budget is the part that actually keeps notes short -- the
  # compactor can only reformat, so a draft that says too much still says too
  # much. Raise it deliberately with TINYTITAN_RELEASE_NOTES_MAX_CHARS.
