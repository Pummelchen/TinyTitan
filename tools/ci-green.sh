# Is CI green on one commit? Used by tools/release.sh before it tags a release,
# and runnable on its own against any commit.
#
#   tools/ci-green.sh Pummelchen/TinyTitan "$(git rev-parse v5.18^{commit})"
#
# The shape of the question matters. A release tag is a claim that the commit it
# names passes, and every other gate in this repository is one machine's view of
# a working tree: only CI runs against a clean clone, on the pinned toolchains,
# across the install matrix. v5.18 was published an hour after its own tag commit
# came back `CI | completed | failure`, because nothing asked.
#
# Three answers are refusals, not warnings:
#   * a run that has not finished -- releasing over an in-flight run is guessing;
#   * no run at all for that sha -- a short sha matches nothing, and a check that
#     queries nothing and reports green is how a vacuous pass gets made;
#   * a conclusion that is not success or skipped, including cancelled, timed
#     out and action-required, each of which means CI did not pass.
#
# `--allow-red "<reason>"` lets a deliberate release continue. It is the same
# bargain as the skipped golden baselines: the reason is mandatory, printed, and
# the caller requires the failing run's URL in the release notes so the choice
# stays on the record.
#
# Output: human-readable lines, then a tab-separated result line for the caller:
#   result        green|overridden       <first red run URL, or ->
# Exit 0 on green or overridden, 1 on any refusal, 2 on a usage or transport
# error (the check could not be made at all).
