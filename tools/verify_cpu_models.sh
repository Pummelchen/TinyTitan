# The whole-model check for the dense CPU models on disk: `TinyTitanBench cpu35`
# must print "all continuations correct" for each.
#
# The equivalence gate (tests/TinyTitan/CPUEngine/DenseSSDAIEquivalenceTests.swift,
# driven by tools/repack_dense.sh) compares logits against the snapshot a repack
# came from. This asks the other question -- does the engine continue real text
# correctly end to end -- so the two are complements, not duplicates.
#
# Each model is faulted into memory (up to 4.5 GB for the 4B at 8 bits) and runs
# on the performance cores, so it refuses to run beside a live model server
# rather than evicting that server's pages or skewing a measurement it is part
# of. That is the guard AGENTS.md states for any model run.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/verify_cpu_models.sh [model ...]        # default: the four below
#
# Model names are directory names under models/.
