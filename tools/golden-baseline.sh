# Capture a deterministic generation baseline, so a refactor of the runtime
# can be checked against byte-identical output rather than "the tests still
# pass". Phase 2 of the production audit needs this before RealForwardRunner
# is decomposed.
#
#   tools/golden-baseline.sh [target ...]     # default: ornith-8
#   tools/golden-baseline.sh --check [...]    # compare against the stored file
#   tools/golden-baseline.sh --server [...]   # CLI and server must agree
#
# Targets: ornith-4, ornith-8, qwen36-4, qwen36-8, qwen38-4, qwen38-8,
# agentworld-4, agentworld-8, katcoder-4, katcoder-8, and the dense
# qwen35-{2b,4b,9b}-{4,8}. The katcoder and qwen35 targets are declared whether
# or not their install is present: a target is inert until the directory is
# there, and release.sh demands the baseline as soon as it is.
# Bare 4 and 8 still mean
# Ornith, because the stored baselines are named for it.
#
# Qwen3.8-Flash-Next is the broader gate: it is the only family exercising
# hyper-connections, the PLE block and the QSA indexer, and at 8-bit it is the
# only one exercising the affine GEMV path through them. Ornith reaches none
# of that, so an Ornith-only baseline can pass while those kernels are wrong.
#
# Determinism comes from greedy decoding: --temperature 0 with a fixed seed and
# a fixed prompt. Greedy means the sampler never draws, so the only inputs are
# the weights and the kernels — exactly what a runtime refactor must not change.
#
# --server exists because the stored baselines only ever drove TinyTitanCLI, and a
# server binary 15 hours older than the runtime it links went unnoticed until
# it refused a promoted 8-bit model by hand. The two modes catch different
# things and neither substitutes for the other:
#
#   the stored file   the runtime changed        (CLI vs its own past output)
#   --server          the two front ends diverged (CLI vs server, same build)
#
# So --server stores nothing. It renders one message list through both paths at
# the same settings and requires the text to match, which needs no re-capture
# after a deliberate numerics change and cannot go stale. Comparing raw
# --prompt output against the server would be meaningless: the server always
# applies the chat template, so both sides are driven from --messages-file.
#
# SCOPE: a baseline is valid for one (machine, build, model) triple. Metal
# reduction order is not guaranteed across GPU families, so a file captured on
# an M3 is not a reference for an M4. Re-capture after a deliberate numerics
# change; a diff at any other time is a regression.

# different reduction order, ~1% mean per-layer deviation -- which is the one
# property this script exists to rely on.
#
# The runner reasons that stored baselines still hold because the ANE path only
# engages at >= one full 4,096-token chunk and the baseline prompt is shorter.
# That is true of the current PROMPT and MAX_NEW, but both are overridable above,
# and a longer PROMPT is the natural thing to pass when testing long context.
# Worse, whether a sidecar exists at all is a property of the machine, not of
# the (machine, build, model) triple the SCOPE note names -- so the reference
# would silently stop meaning one thing. A gate whose meaning depends on an
# unrelated local file is not a gate.
#
# This measures the GPU path, deliberately not following the default: the ANE
# path is a qualified speed/quality trade rather than the reference arithmetic,
# and a regression in the GPU path is what this has to catch.
