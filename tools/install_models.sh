Sources

  Every install is built from the model's own bf16 release, quantized here
  (group-64 affine) by the tools in tools/ and imported by TinyTitanRepack.
  Third-party quantizations are deliberately not used: their group sizes,
  widths and norm conventions are theirs, and here the router, the
  shared-expert gate, the DeltaNet gating projections and every norm stay
  at bf16 in both widths.

  convert_qwen35moe   tools/prepare_agentworld.py --model {ornith15,qwen36,agentworld,katcoder}
                      One ~70 GB download yields both widths, so
                      `<name> both` installs 4-bit and 8-bit for the cost of
                      one fetch; one width alone already converts both and
                      keeps the other snapshot for a later run.
  convert_qwen35      tools/prepare_qwen35.py --size {2b,4b,9b}, then
                      TinyTitanRepack --input-snapshot. One fetch yields both
                      widths. These are the dense models, and the only ones
                      the CPU engine runs; the 9B is the vision-language
                      build, converted text-only like the others.
                      tools/repack_dense.sh re-runs the repack and the
                      equivalence check against a retained snapshot.
  convert             tools/prepare_qwen38.py, one 360 GB fetch per width.
                      Qwen's own FP8 build is not used either: it quantizes
                      only the routed experts, in [128, 128] blocks that do
                      not map onto affine group-64.
  convert_qwen36_mtp  the same converter's --draft-head mode (two shards).
  convert_qwen38_mtp  tools/prepare_qwen38_mtp.py (31 tensors, range-fetched).
  prepare_ornith_mtp  tools/prepare_ornith_mtp.py (shard 16 of the original).

explains it, this message is stale and the row should be fixed rather than
