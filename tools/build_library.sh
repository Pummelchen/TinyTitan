# packaging can be inspected without cutting a release).
#
# Why the archive is merged: `swift build` writes one `.a` per target, and
# `libTinyTitanLib.a` alone does not contain the runtime, the format reader, the
# C kernels or the tokenizer package. A consumer linking that single file would
# fail on every symbol one layer down, so this collects every archive the
# release build produced into one, which is what a static distribution has to be.
#
# Why the dylib is renamed: the dynamic product is built under its own product
# name (`TinyTitanLibDynamic`, so that the SwiftPM-facing `TinyTitanLib` stays
# static for source consumers), and it is linked with an install name of
# `@rpath/libTinyTitanLib.dylib` so the shipped file can carry the plain name.

TinyTitan $VERSION — the library product (macOS, Apple Silicon / arm64)

Built from tag $VERSION with: tools/build_library.sh
Requires macOS 26+. Apple Silicon only; there is no x86_64 build.

Contents
  libTinyTitanLib.a          static archive: the library and every dependency
                             it needs, merged into one file
  libTinyTitanLib.dylib      the same library, dynamically linked
  TinyTitanLib.swiftmodule   the Swift module — plus every module it imports,
                             because a binary module does not stand alone
  *.modulemap                the generated module maps for the C targets in the
                             graph (the kernels, yyjson, NIO's shims, ...),
                             which SwiftPM normally passes one by one
  make-flags.sh              writes swiftc-flags.txt naming those maps, because
                             the paths only exist once you have extracted this
  demo/                      two terminal apps built from one source — one
                             linked against the static archive, one against the
                             dylib — with the scripts that build them
  TinyTitan_TinyTitan.bundle the Metal shader sources, compiled when the library
                             loads; the bundle must sit next to the executable
                             that uses the library
  LICENSE, NOTICE, THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md

Linking. The C module maps have to be named explicitly, so run the generator
once (it writes swiftc-flags.txt with the paths of *this* directory), then:

  ./make-flags.sh

  static:   swiftc -I . @swiftc-flags.txt mytool.swift libTinyTitanLib.a -o mytool
  dynamic:  swiftc -I . @swiftc-flags.txt -L . -lTinyTitanLib mytool.swift \\
              -Xlinker -rpath -Xlinker "\$PWD" -o mytool

Both lines were run against this archive before it was published. Run the result
from a directory that holds TinyTitan_TinyTitan.bundle (and the two dependency
bundles), or copy them beside the executable: the runtime finds its shaders
through Bundle.module, which resolves next to the binary.

The API is the public surface of the TinyTitanLib module: Engine, Session,
EngineConfiguration, ChatMessage, GenerationOptions, GenerationEvent,
GenerationSummary and TinyTitanError. See the wiki page "Library and Engine".

This is the binary form for a consumer that cannot or will not build from
source. Building the package as a SwiftPM dependency remains the supported
route and needs none of these flags. The module is built by this release's
toolchain (Xcode 27 / Swift 6.4), which is the only supported one: it is not
module-stable across toolchains and does not need to be, because no other
toolchain is supported.

No model weights are included: the library reads a .ssdai install and never
downloads one.

These binaries are NOT code-signed or notarized. Clear the quarantine attribute
after verifying the checksum published with this archive:

  xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /path/to/this/directory

# Both shipping forms are checked before the directory is declared staged: the
# static archive and the dynamic library are the files a consumer links, and
# `lipo -archs` reads an `!<arch>` container (measured: `arm64`), so the `.a` is
# not a hole in the assertion. The 29 `.swiftmodule` files beside them are Swift
# bitcode and are excluded by magic rather than by name.
