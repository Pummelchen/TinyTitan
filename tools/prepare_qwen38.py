"""Convert Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next into an affine snapshot TinyTitanRepack imports.

Why this exists: the installed 4-bit model came from a third-party MLX repack.
TinyTitan does not need one. It needs an affine group-64 layout, and it can produce
that from Qwen's own bf16 release, which is both better provenance and better
numerics -- quantizing once from the original weights beats inheriting somebody
else's quantization error.

The checkpoint is 360 GB across 131 shards. Nothing here holds the whole thing:
one shard is fetched, converted and deleted before the next is needed, with a
background thread fetching shard N+1 while shard N converts. Peak disk is the
output plus one shard.

Three things the official checkpoint does differently from the MLX repack the
runtime was built against. Each is a silent mis-load if assumed rather than
checked, so `--plan` asserts all three against the checkpoint's own headers:

1. Routed experts are *stacked and fused*: one `mlp.experts.gate_up_proj` of
   shape [512, 1280, 2560] per layer, where 1280 is gate and up concatenated,
   plus one `mlp.experts.down_proj`. TinyTitanRepack wants three separately named
   tensors matching `.mlp.switch_mlp.{gate,up,down}_proj.`, each of which may
   stay stacked over the 512 experts because the planner slices per expert.
2. Norms carry `.weight` here and do not in the repack the runtime reads, so
   `hc_norm.weight` becomes `hc_norm`. `linear_attn.norm.weight` keeps its
   suffix -- the schema asks for that one *with* `.weight`.
3. `lm_head` sits at the archive root, not under `model.language_model.`.

`ple_constants.json` is derived here rather than copied, using the algorithm in
the transformers reference (`_build_layer_multipliers`, `_find_nth_prime_after`).
The derivation reproduces the previously shipped constants exactly -- multipliers,
the sixteen prime head vocabularies and their offsets all match -- which is what
lets this run without any dependency on the third-party repack.

    This mirrors the runtime's slot model *plus its per-tensor overrides*. `Model`
    derives a tensor's expected size from `manifest.quant.<slot>.weightBits` and
    builds one GEMV per *role*, so a role shares one width — but a tensor whose
    width differs from its slot carries an override keyed by stem, which the
    repacker writes (`SSDAIJSON.quantObject`), the format validates
    (`SSDAIManifestV1`), and the runtime resolves per tensor
    (`ManifestQuant.slot(forTensorNamed:overrides:fallback:)`). The dense
    Qwen 3.5 installs are built exactly that way: `mlp.*` at 4 bits against an
    8-bit slot, full-attention `k_proj`/`v_proj` at 8 against a 4-bit one.

    One pair is the exception, and it is the pair this converter promotes: the
    GDN `a`/`b` projections. The fused QKV+Z+A+B kernel takes a *bf16-or-slot*
    flag rather than a width and its quantized branch is int4, so the runtime
    refuses a quantized override for them by name
    (`Model.validateRoleUniformity`). A 16-bit override is honoured, which is
    the only width asked for here.

    The slots, matching what a working install carries:

        embedding     8   embed_tokens, lm_head
        router        8   mlp.gate
        attention   `width`   q/k/v/o, GDN, hyper-connection, indexer, PLE
        sharedExpert `width`  shared_expert.*, shared_expert_gate
        routedExpert `width`  switch_mlp.*

    This is why the router already sits at 8 bits in a 4-bit build: it has its
    own slot. The measurement in tools/precision_probe.py says the QSA indexer,
    the hyper-connection write gate and the PLE key projection deserve more
    precision -- the indexer picks the same keys 0.0% of the time at 4 bits
    against 49.5% at 8, for about 10 MB. Taking the whole attention slot to 8
    bits instead is measured and *works*, but it is 61% of the active parameters
    and +2.10 GB resident (Engineering Notes, "8-bit attention slot"); these
    tensors are ~10 MB. A per-tensor override is how they get the precision
    cheaply, and the runtime resolves one for all three families --
    `Model.hyperConnectionWeightBits`, `pleKeyWeightBits`,
    `qsaIndexerWeightBits`, uniform across the family because one kernel serves
    every layer. What this converter does not yet do is ask for it, and the
    8-bit indexer was measured and rejected on its own (2.4 points on marginal
    keys), so the promotion is a decision per tensor rather than a switch.
