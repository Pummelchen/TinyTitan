# Give every installed GPU-path model the ANE sidecar it needs, and verify it.
#
# A model without a sidecar has no ANE prefill at all: the switch is on by
# default, the runtime asks for the sidecar, and finds nothing — which is how
# the dense Qwen 3.5 family spent its whole life on the GPU with the feature
# apparently enabled. So the sidecar is part of installing a model, not an
# experiment to remember afterwards.
#
# Exporting compiles one Core ML program per full-attention layer, per
# history variant, so it takes minutes per model and is skipped when the
# sidecar already exists. Verification is cheap and always runs: it compares the
# exported graph against an independent NumPy implementation of the same
# attention block, which is the check that a wrong geometry cannot pass.
#
#   tools/ane_sidecars.sh                 # every install, export what is missing
#   tools/ane_sidecars.sh qwen3.5_4B_4Bit # one install
#   tools/ane_sidecars.sh --chunk 1024    # the width for the band under 4,096
#   tools/ane_sidecars.sh --force         # re-export even where one exists
#   tools/ane_sidecars.sh --verify-only   # no export, just check what is there
#
# Exits non-zero if any model it was asked about is still without a verified
# sidecar, so it can gate an install. Three statuses, the tree's table: 0 every
# candidate the walk found is verified, 1 one it was asked about is not, 2 it did
# not get to run -- an option it does not take, a chunk the runtime would not
# route, an interpreter it cannot use, or a models directory holding no install
# to ask about. Reporting that last shape as 0 would be a pass over a check that
# looked at nothing.
