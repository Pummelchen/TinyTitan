"""Convert Qwen3.5's dense text models (2B, 4B) from bf16 into affine snapshots.

These are the small models the CPU engine serves, and the same architecture
family the 35B installs already use: gated-DeltaNet with gated full attention
every fourth layer, a fused output gate in `q_proj`, and rotary confined to
the first 64 of 256 head elements. Three things differ from
`prepare_agentworld.py`, and they are the whole of this file's reason to
exist:

  * **Dense feed-forward.** `mlp.{gate,up,down}_proj` in every layer, where
    the 35B has a router, 256 routed experts and a shared expert. Nothing
    here fuses or splits an expert tensor.
  * **Tied output, except the 9B.** The 2B and 4B ship no `lm_head`; their
    card says the LM output is tied to the token embedding, and the snapshot
    records that rather than duplicating 508M (2B) or 636M (4B) parameters,
    so the reader must honour the tie. The 9B is the vision-language build
    and does ship a root-level `lm_head.weight`, which is carried through as
    `language_model.lm_head.weight` and marked untied. Either way the head
    itself is kept at 8 bits in both build widths.
  * **Streamed.** It is run beside a resident model that holds most of the
    machine's memory, so no tensor is ever held whole: every matrix is read
    and quantized in row chunks, and each output shard's header is planned
    from the source headers first so every chunk is written straight to its
    final offset. Peak RSS is a few hundred megabytes whatever the size;
    the 4B embedding alone is 1.3 GB at bf16 and would be 2.5 GB as the
    float32 the quantizer works in.

The three sizes differ in shape, not kind, and every dimension the runtime
needs is read from the config this writes:

    size  layers  hidden  attention q/kv  delta-rule k/v heads  source shards
    2b      24     2048       8 / 2            16 / 16                1
    4b      32     2560      16 / 4            16 / 32                2
    9b      32     4096      16 / 4            16 / 32                4

The 4B's 32 value heads over 16 key heads is the one shape the 2B never
exercised; the engine's head-sharing tests pin it, and the 9B repeats it at
a wider hidden size rather than adding a fourth shape. The 9B is the
vision-language build: its checkpoint nests the text model under
`text_config` and ships a `model.visual.*` tower that this converter drops,
so it produces the same text-only snapshot as the other two.

Verified against each checkpoint before converting it, not assumed:
`input_layernorm`, `post_attention_layernorm`, `q_norm`, `k_norm` and the
final `norm` are stored zero-centred and the +1 is folded in here, exactly as
the 35B converters do. Means over every tensor of each kind, in that order:
2B +0.226, +0.140, +0.498, +0.495, +2.536; 4B +0.183, +0.112, +0.503,
+0.491, +2.195 -- each with minimums near -1, which a stored scale would not
have. `linear_attn.norm` is the gated norm, stored around one (2B mean
+0.915, minimum +0.246; 4B mean +0.961, minimum +0.117) and is left alone.
Getting that backwards was the only bug in the AgentWorld port. (The 2B
figures first recorded here, +0.096 and so on, were single tensors: layer
0's input norm, layer 3's q_norm.)

    python3.13 tools/prepare_qwen35.py --size 4b --plan
    python3.13 tools/prepare_qwen35.py --size 4b --bits 4 8 \\
        --output models/qwen3.5_4B_{bits}Bit --work .build/qwen35-4b-shards
    python3.13 tools/prepare_qwen35.py --size 2b --bits 8 \\
        --output .build/qwen35-2b-affine-8bit --work .build/qwen35-2b-shards

`tools/install_models.sh qwen35-2b|qwen35-4b|qwen35-9b` runs exactly this
and then imports the snapshot, so the result is a verified `.ssdai` install
rather than a bare snapshot the catalog cannot list.

Disk while running: the shard being converted and the one downloading behind
it (4B: 5.3 + 4.0 GB; 9B: 10.6 + 8.0 GB), plus the outputs (4B: 2.7 GB at
4-bit, 4.5 GB at 8; 9B: 6.1 GB at 4-bit, 9.5 GB at 8).
