"""What do the watchdogs say about replies that were fine?

A threshold picked by eye is a guess, and a guess that stops a good
generation costs the user the whole answer. This runs the detectors over
every reply this project has recorded -- the book and coder benchmark runs
across five models -- and counts how often each one would have fired. All of
those replies completed; every trip here is therefore a false positive, and
the target is zero.

    python3.13 benchmark/watchdog_calibrate.py
    python3.13 benchmark/watchdog_calibrate.py --repeats 5 --window 48
    python3.13 benchmark/watchdog_calibrate.py --show 3   # what tripped

The loop and stub detectors are ports of the Swift ones in
`sources/TinyTitanServer/Core/Watchdogs/`. `--selftest` checks both against the
shared fixture the Swift unit tests use, so the port cannot drift silently.

Two watchdogs are not calibrated here, for reasons rather than by omission:

  * **stall** has no text to run on. Its threshold is set against measured
    decode rates -- 6.7 to 20 tokens a second on this machine, so a 90-second
    gap after the first token is four hundred times a normal inter-token
    interval -- and against the prefill it deliberately does not watch (B1).
  * **ping-pong** needs recorded tool-arm conversations with their message
    histories. Those are replayed from the journal files when present, and
    reported as unavailable when not. Its trips count against the run like the
    other two, and a corpus that is not there leaves it unmeasured rather than
    clean.

`main()` answers 0 the three calibrated rules ran on their corpora and tripped
nothing, 1 the calibration did not get to run -- no replies, or a rule that saw
no corpus, with which rule named, 2 it ran and a watchdog fired on a reply that
completed -- and a trip outranks the incomplete note, because a measured false
positive is the finding, not an absence to file under.

`--selftest` answers 0 the port agrees with the Swift fixture on every case, 1
a mismatch or a fixture that is not there. Those codes are this driver's
own and run the other way round from the 0 / 1 contested / 2 NOT MEASURED table
the other benchmark drivers answer; AUD-292 records the numbering as an open
decision rather than settling it here.
