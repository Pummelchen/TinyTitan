"""Does persistent memory keep a hundred-chapter novel consistent?

The failure this measures is the one that ships: chapter 3 fixes a
character's eyes as grey, chapter 71 makes them blue, and nobody notices
because chapter 3 left the context window sixty chapters ago.

The novel is written in ten sessions of ten chapters. Each session is a new
conversation -- a rollover -- so nothing survives between them except what
the arm's mechanism carries. Session 1 gets the bible. Later sessions get
only the chapter range and, on five of them, a plot event that happens in
that range. At the end of every session the model answers a fixed continuity
quiz as JSON, and the quiz is scored against the bible and against which
events have happened by then.

Four arms, identical chapter prompts:

    summary   no memory; the harness asks for a 200-word summary at the end
              of each session and prepends it to the next. This is what a
              client's own compaction does, so it is the honest baseline.
    auto      memory on, no tools: the bootstrap fragment alone, with nothing
              the model can write back.
    minimal   memory on, memory_set and memory_get, journal on
    full      memory on, all six tools, journal on

A control with nothing carried is not run: it scores zero on every carried
fact by construction, and ten sessions of generation to confirm that is not
a measurement.

- Ines, green eyes, the town archivist. Secret: she knows who is in it.
- Tomas, Marcus's brother, missing since before chapter 1.

- Rosa, hazel eyes, keeps the inn.
