"""Does persistent memory help a coding agent across sessions?

The experiment: build Pong with two autoplaying computer players in Swift,
then port it to Python, then to C99. Three sessions, not three turns, because
memory's whole claim is about what survives when the conversation ends.

The prompts for stages 2 and 3 deliberately do not restate what stage 1
decided. A model with no memory has to invent the field size, the win score
and the paddle strategy again; a model with memory can carry them. That gap
is the measurement.

Two arms, identical prompts:

    control   memory off
    minimal   memory on, two tools (set, get), journal on
    full      memory on, all six tools, journal on

The third arm exists because the tool schemas, not the memory fragment, are
what memory actually costs: measured on this model the six definitions are
about 1,120 prompt tokens against roughly 210 for the fragment. If two tools
carry the same decisions, most of the tax was avoidable.

What is measured, and why it differs by store:

  Curated memory can change what the model writes, so it gets an A/B and a
  carry-over rate over the parameters stage 1 fixed.

  The journal is never injected into context, so it cannot change output at
  all. Measuring it for quality would be a category error. It is measured on
  what it captured, what that cost, and whether a later question can be
  answered from it.
