"""How often does the extraction mislabel who said something?

The memory guard rests on one bit per fact: did the *person* assert this, or
did the model derive it? With the guard on, a fact labelled `user` can no
longer be silently superseded. That is protection when the label is right
and damage when it is wrong -- a fact the model invented and then had
protected is worse than today's behaviour, not merely different. So the
label's error rate has to be measured before the guard is switched on
anywhere, and this is that measurement.

It reads a recorded book run's journal, which holds every fact the engine
wrote together with the provenance author the label became, and scores each
fact claiming the person's authority
against what the person actually put in front of the model in that session:
the story bible plus the plot events delivered up to that point
(`memory_sim.user_text`). A fact claiming to come from the user whose
substance is nowhere in the user's own words is a mislabel.

    python3.13 benchmark/guard_source_rate.py                    # newest run
    python3.13 benchmark/guard_source_rate.py --label guard-step0
    python3.13 benchmark/guard_source_rate.py --show             # each fact

**This finds candidates; it does not decide.** Word overlap cannot judge a
fact whose claim lives in its key and whose value is a boolean --
`continuity/marcus_knows_photo = false` is the bible's hard rule and neither
word appears in what the person wrote. Scored on the value alone it reported
nine mislabels on a run that had none; scored on key and value together it
reported six across three runs, and hand review found all six correct. The
flags are worth reading and the count is not worth trusting.

So the gate is: run this, read every flag, and record the verdict. The list
is small -- two to nine per run -- which is what makes that practical.

The gate itself, from `docs/plan-memory-guard-and-shadow.md`: under 5%
mislabelled, and no invented fact labelled `user` at all.

The scoring is deliberately generous to the model. A fact counts as
grounded if its *distinctive* words -- the ones carrying the claim, not the
scaffolding -- appear in the user's text. Paraphrase passes; only a value
the user never said anywhere fails. That direction is the safe one: it
under-reports mislabels, so a rate this measures as low could be lower still
but never higher.
