"""Memory against a real model, in three requests.

Not a benchmark: a check that the wiring does what the unit tests say it
does when a 35B model is on the other end. A novel session stores a fact,
a codebase session must not see it, a second novel session must. Placement
is by the working directory the client declares, exactly as Claude Code
and Codex declare it, so this is the book-versus-git case end to end.

    benchmark/memval_run.sh smoke      # memory on, no tools: the engine must do the writing
