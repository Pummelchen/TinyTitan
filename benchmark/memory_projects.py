"""S4: does memory keep two projects apart when they say similar things?

Workspace isolation is the assumption the whole memory design rests on -- one
server, several checkouts, and a novel's facts never in a codebase's bootstrap
-- and nothing measures it against a real model. The unit tests prove the
scope keys differ; they cannot prove that what the engine distilled from
project A stays out of project B's bootstrap.

Two projects are worked on alternately in one server lifetime, ten sessions,
A B A B ... Each is a data pipeline, and they are deliberately confusable:
both have a component called ingest, a retry policy, a primary datastore and a
release cadence, with different values in each. A leak that swaps two
unrelated facts is easy to spot in any transcript; the leak that actually
happens is Postgres for ClickHouse, and that is the one this scores.

Every session ends with an eight-key JSON quiz about the current project only,
scored twice:

    correct   the answer is this project's truth
    leaked    the answer is THE OTHER project's truth

An answer can be neither: absent, or a value neither project holds. The leak
count is what matters. A lost point is a memory that did not carry; a leak is
a defect, and one leak is worse than eight blanks.

Two arms:

    control   memory off. Scores near zero on carried facts by construction,
              and must leak nothing: the prompts of a session never contain
              the other project's values, so a leak here would be the scoring
              or the harness, not memory. This is the arm that makes the
              "auto" leak count mean something.
    auto      memory on, no memory tools, journal on: the engine writes.
