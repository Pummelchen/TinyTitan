"""`tools/ci-green.sh` decides whether a commit may be tagged and published.

The row this pins (AUD-105) is a real one: v5.18 was published an hour after its
own tag commit came back `CI | completed | failure`. Nothing asked CI before
publishing, and `docs/release-process.md` said "a green main" in prose while no
check read it. So the arithmetic here is the whole defence, and every branch of
it is tested against a stub `gh` -- green, red, still running, and the two shapes
that would let a vacuous pass through: a commit CI never saw, and a short sha the
API matches against nothing.

Run from `benchmark/`:

    python3 -m unittest test_release_ci_green
