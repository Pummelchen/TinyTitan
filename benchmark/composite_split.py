"""Can the side-engine tell which half of a fact the person actually said?

The guard's gate failed on one of two models, and both failures were the
same shape. Ornith wrote `characters/rosa` as "Rosa: hazel eyes, keeps the
inn; raised a new inn from charred walls in chapter 65" and labelled it as
the person's. The first clause is theirs, from the story bible. The second
is the model's own chapter 65. One key, two sources, one label -- and no
label is right.

That is upstream of the guard: `source` cannot be a property of a value that
has two sources, and a guard which protects a composite protects the
invented half of it. A better prompt cannot fix it, because the question has
no answer as posed.

So this asks a different question, of the small model that is now resident:
given what the person actually wrote, which parts of this fact did they
state? It is a verification task rather than an extraction one, which is
what the earlier measurements said a 2B is good for.

Scored automatically, against the same grounding metric the gate uses, with
no hand labelling: a fact whose invented clause is removed goes from
ungrounded to grounded, and a fact that was already the person's must not be
damaged.

    python3.13 benchmark/composite_split.py --prepare jobs.jsonl
    .build/.../TinyTitanBench cpu35batch <snapshot> jobs.jsonl done.jsonl
    python3.13 benchmark/composite_split.py --score done.jsonl

**Answer, measured twice: no.** Over the 47 facts that claimed the person's
authority across two recorded runs, of which exactly 2 are genuinely
mislabelled:

| prompt | repaired | damaged |
| --- | --- | --- |
| value alone | 0 | 6 |
| with the key, and told that wording may differ | 1 | 3 |

The first run withheld the key, so the model was asked to attribute "brown"
with no idea it was an eye colour; giving it the key and telling it that
"the inn burns" and "burned" are the same thing halved the damage and bought
one repair. It is still net negative, and the damage is concentrated exactly
where the repairs were supposed to be: shown "Aldo: blue eyes, the mayor;
unlocks the pre-decommission lighthouse records in chapter 64", which is
half the person's and half the model's, it answers NONE rather than keeping
the half that is theirs.

So the side-engine does not solve this, and a third prompt would be tuning
toward a desired answer on a set with two positives in it. The composite has
to be prevented at the source rather than repaired afterwards. This file
stays because the negative is worth keeping and re-running when either the
model or the extraction changes.
