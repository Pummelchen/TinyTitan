"""AUD-271: seven gates in `tools/lint.sh` report `ok` over a scan that read no files.

`tools/lint.sh` is the harness behind eighteen of this repository's gates, and six
of its checks already refuse to certify an empty scan:

    raise "no Swift files under #{root}" if paths.empty?   # unbounded-read
    if [ -z "$scanned" ] || [ "$scanned" -eq 0 ]; then     # func-length, file-length,
                                                           # test-hollow
    if not scanned:                                        # stdout-clean
    print("SCANNED:0") + the shell guard over it           # library-facade

`AGENTS.md` states the rule for the whole family -- "a gate that did not run reading
as a pass is the exact defect it hunts". The guards are named here by their check, not
by line number: every one of them shifted when this fix added lines above it, and a
citation that drifts is worse than none. Seven checks in the same file had no guard
at all, and measured on this host each exited **0** over a tree holding nothing it can
read:

    force-cast  `grep -rnE ... "$ROOT/sources" 2>/dev/null` -- an absent or
                unreadable `sources/` makes grep fail, its status is dropped by the
                process substitution, its stderr is hidden, and `found` stays 0  -> ok
    arch-path   `Path(".").rglob(ext)`, no counter, no expectation              -> ok (none)
    shell       `find ... 2>/dev/null`; the count is printed but never tested    -> ok (0 scripts)
    test-skip   `Path("tests").rglob(...)` yields nothing and raises nothing,
                measured on the interpreter the gate targets                     -> ok (none)
    sendable    empty glob plus no baseline writes an empty baseline and calls
                it a pass                                                        -> ok (baseline created, 0 entries)
    swift-format  `--recursive sources tests benchmark Package.swift examples`, and
                  the tool reads a path argument that is missing or empty without
                  complaint -- found by the sibling sweep, not by the report       -> ok
    python        `rglob` over benchmark/, tools/, docs/ parses nothing on an empty
                  tree while ruff answers "All checks passed!" to no files         -> ok

The remaining modes were measured on the same empty tree and do refuse: `converter`
names its missing dependency, `shellcheck` has its own "no shell scripts found"
branch, `swiftlint` exits on "No lintable files found", `javascript` counts the
packages it checked, and `docs` cannot open a `docs-facts.py` that is not there.
Fail-closed is not the same as counted, and only the seven above are pinned here.

So "the gates are green" -- the evidence every close in `docs/audit-2026-10-06/`
cites -- says nothing about code the harness never opened. The trigger is not
hypothetical: this checkout was renamed once and `AGENTS.md` records that receipts
and `.build` broke, func-length's own comment records the pass-on-nothing that
already happened here, and a wrapper that copies `tools/` somewhere else moves `ROOT`
with it.

The tests build a throwaway tree, put a copy of the harness one directory down so
its derived `ROOT` is the stub and nothing here can read or write the real checkout,
and assert both directions: an empty scan is refused and named, and a non-empty tree
that satisfies the rule still passes. Without the second half a guard that always
refused would score as a fix, which is the same injury in the other direction.

Six of the tests are controls over guards that already existed, and they earned
their place: breaking one guard per mutant, the first sweep killed 19 of 20 and the
survivor was `library-facade` -- named above as already guarded, tested by nothing
here. The suite is what changed after that, not the harness. The sweep now breaks one
guard per mutant across all seven new guards and those six controls, and 27 of 27
mutants die; each guard is broken three ways, so it must fire on an empty scan, stay
silent on a clean one, and actually move the exit status.
