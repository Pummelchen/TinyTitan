"""Run the book and the coder benchmark against a small local model.

The memory work so far asked whether a small model can keep the store for
the 35B. This asks the opposite question: how much continuity does a small
model have on its own? It runs the same two benchmarks, scored by the same
code, against llama.cpp on the CPU -- so the numbers sit directly beside
every 35B row already measured.

Only the memory-off arms make sense here: llama-server has no memory
feature, so `summary` (the harness carries a 200-word note) and `control`
(nothing is carried) are what a small model can be asked for. That is the
right comparison anyway -- it is the baseline column of every install table.

The harness is driven rather than edited, because the matrix is invoking the
same modules and a change to them would reach a run in flight.
