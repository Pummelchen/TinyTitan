"""Does persistent memory follow the user when the user changes their mind?

The two scenarios that exist measure memory as accumulation: the pong
benchmark carries decisions forward, the book benchmark keeps a bible from
drifting. Both reward remembering more. Neither ever contradicts itself, so
neither can catch the failure that makes a memory system worse than no
memory at all: the user revises a decision in session 5 and the system keeps
handing the model the session-1 value for the rest of the project. A stale
fact is not a missing fact. A missing fact makes the model ask; a stale one
makes it confidently build the wrong thing.

The project is LEDGERLINE, a small ledger service, designed over eight
sessions. Each session is a new conversation -- a rollover -- so nothing
survives between them except what the arm's mechanism carries. Session 1 is
the brief and states eight decisions. Sessions 2 and 3 do ordinary work on
them. Sessions 4, 5 and 6 each revise exactly one decision and say so.
Sessions 7 and 8 do work that only comes out right if the revisions stuck.
Every session ends with the same ten-key quiz answered as JSON.

The scoring is what makes this a different measurement. `truth(session)`
returns the answer that is correct AS OF that session, so a revision flips
the expected answer from that session on, and the report splits the score
into revised keys and unrevised keys. An arm can only win the revised half
by preferring the latest statement; an arm that injects everything it ever
learned and lets the model pick will score well on the unrevised half and
badly on the revised half, and that split is the result.

Two arms, identical prompts:

    control   memory off. Not a zero by construction the way it is in the
              book scenario: each revision session states its new value in
              the prompt, so control gets that key right in that session and
              wrong afterwards. That shape -- right once, then gone -- is the
              floor the memory arm has to beat.
    auto      memory on, no tools, journal on. Consolidation is the only
              writer, which is the configuration a user gets by default and
              the one where a stale fact is nobody's explicit mistake.

- Concurrency model: a single-threaded event loop. No worker threads, no
  shared-memory parallelism.
- Target platform: Linux x86-64 containers only. Not macOS, not Windows.

- Tests: Jest, one spec file per module.
