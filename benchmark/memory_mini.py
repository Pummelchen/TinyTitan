"""Can a small resident model keep the memory instead of the 35B?

Consolidation is the one recurring inference cost the memory feature has: at
every session boundary the served model reads the session back and writes out
what must not be contradicted, for 1.5-2k prompt tokens and 45-55 seconds on a
35B at 4-bit. That is the whole overhead of the feature, and it is spent on a
task -- turn prose into short addressed facts -- that is extraction, not
reasoning. A few hundred megabytes of resident model can do extraction.

This replays the recorded sessions through a small local model (llama.cpp,
CPU, so the GPU stays with the 35B), puts its output in a store, and reads
that store with exactly the reader memory_sim.py uses for the 35B's own
writes. Same transcripts, same reader, same scoring: the only thing that
changes is who did the extracting.

Two jobs are measured, because the simulation says they are not equally hard:

  full     the whole session, user turn and model output, as the 35B sees it
  capture  the user's turn alone -- short, authoritative, and the job worth
           +2.9 points on the projected book score
