"""Offline replay of the book benchmark's memory, so a store policy can be
tested in seconds instead of two days of 35B generations.

Every recorded run left three things behind: the chapters the model wrote and
the quiz it answered (memory-book-<install>/auto-rN.json), and every memory
write the engine made, with its provenance (the workspace journal under
memval-scratch-<install>/book-auto-rN/). The model's output is therefore
fixed and replayable. What a policy change alters is not what the model said
but what the store *kept* -- and that is entirely reconstructable offline.

The simulation answers one question: at the end of session N, would a reader
of the store have known the right answer to each quiz question? That is not
the benchmark's score, and this file does not pretend it is. It is the
upstream half, and the runs measured its relation to the downstream half:
when the store held the right value the model answered correctly in 7 of 8
runs, and when the store held a wrong value the model was wrong in 4 of 4.
`validate` re-measures that agreement every time, so the proxy is never
trusted further than it has just been shown to hold.

    benchmark/memory_sim.py validate     # how well the reader tracks the model
    benchmark/memory_sim.py compare      # store fidelity under each policy
