"""Can the model go and look, when the answer is past the bootstrap cap?

Scenario S5, "Retrieval at volume".

Everything the memory system has been measured on so far fits in the
bootstrap. A novel's bible is thirty facts; Pong in three languages is
twenty. Those tell us whether memory carries a fact from session one to
session ten, and the answer was yes -- but they never ask the model to
*fetch* anything, because the fragment already handed it everything there
was. The six `memory_*` functions ship off and have never been measured at
a volume where a bootstrap cannot hold the store.

This scenario builds that volume. Ten sessions catalogue a fictional
infrastructure estate: thirty-five services, each arriving with an owner, a
port, a dependency, a runbook and an on-call rotation. That is 175 durable
attribute facts plus the service names, established by writing handbook
prose rather than by dumping a table, so consolidation has ordinary work to
extract from. Nothing is ever restated: a service is written up once and
never mentioned in a prompt again.

The bootstrap is capped at 60 records and 16 KiB, each value summarised to
200 characters. A store of this size cannot fit, and the fragment ends in
"...and N more". So the later sessions ask for attributes of services
catalogued four or more sessions earlier and never asked about since. Those
are the *buried* keys, and they are the point of the scenario:

  - The record may have been cut outright by the count or byte cap.
  - Even a record that survived the cut shows only its first 200
    characters, and the tail attributes -- runbook, rotation -- are what
    falls past that.
  - Ordering is importance first, then OLDEST first, so age alone does not
    bury a fact. Volume and the 200-character summary do. This is worth
    stating plainly because the obvious design ("ask about old things")
    would measure nothing on its own.

Whether a key is genuinely outside the prompt is not assumed. The harness
scrapes the server log for the per-request `bootstrap=N` count and for the
keys consolidation stored, so the report shows the store outgrowing the cap
rather than asserting it.

Three arms, identical prompts:

    control   memory off. It scores whatever the model can infer from the
              session in front of it, which is the floor a memory arm has
              to clear.
    auto      memory on, tools off. Bootstrap only. This is the arm that
              should struggle on buried keys: it is handed key names and
              200-character gists and has no way to read a value.
    full      memory on, all six tools. It can go and look.

If `full` does not beat `auto` on buried keys, the tool surface is not
earning its prompt tax and should stay off. A `full` arm that scores well
without ever calling a tool has measured nothing, so tool calls per session
and turns that exhausted their tool rounds are reported beside the scores.
