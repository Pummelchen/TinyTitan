# The `.ssdai` install format

`SSDAIEncoders.swift` has pointed at this file since the resident index was
first written. It did not exist. This is it.

A `.ssdai` install is a directory. It is the only install shape this project
ships: the runtime, the installer and `--verify-install` all
assume it. The dense Qwen 3.5 2B/4B/9B installs used to be the exception — an
affine safetensors snapshot with no manifest and no receipt — and they are
`.ssdai` now too (`tools/repack_dense.sh`).

```
qwen3.5_2B_4Bit/
  manifest.json            the architecture, the widths, and a hash of every file
  model_weights.bin        the resident tensors: one index, then one payload
  packed_experts/
    layout.json            the per-layer expert blob layout
    layer_00.bin ...       one file per layer that has routed experts
  tokenizer/
    tokenizer.json
    tokenizer_config.json
    chat_template.jinja
  verified-install.json    the path-bound receipt
```

Everything is little-endian. Every field is read and written in one place,
`SSDAIBinary` (`sources/TinyTitanRepack/Core/Format/SSDAIEncoders.swift`), so the
on-disk layout changes only there.

## Naming: `.ssdai`, renamed from `.gturbo` in 5.15

The file was called `.gturbo` from the first commit — a fossil of the project's
Gemma-4/TurboFieldfare era — and **the rename changed one field, not one byte of
payload**. What that means in practice:

- `manifest.json`'s `magic` is written as `"SSDAI"`, and **reads accept the
  legacy `"GTURBO"`** for one release (`SSDAIFormatV1.isSupportedMagic`). Every
  install built before 5.15 therefore keeps loading untouched.
- Existing manifests are deliberately **not** rewritten in place. The receipt
  (`verified-install.json`) binds the manifest's digest and the directory path,
  so editing the magic would invalidate the receipt of every install in
  existence — 244 GB here alone — for a string. An install moves to the new
  magic the next time it is rebuilt or repacked anyway, and `--verify-install`
  accepts either.
- The directory's `.ssdai` suffix is a **convention, not a check**: nothing in
  the reader looks at the path's extension, so a directory still named
  `something.gturbo` works exactly as well.
- `TinyTitanRepack --input-ssdai <dir>` is the flag; `--input-gturbo` stays
  accepted as a deprecated alias for one release.

Docs written before 5.15 — release notes, the v4.x design and plan records, and
`plan-dense-gturbo-installs.md` — keep the old word on purpose: they are records
of what the format was called when they were written.

## Why the format exists

The models are 19-200 GB and the machines are 24-128 GB. A `.ssdai` install is
built so that **the runtime never has to hold the whole model**, and so that a
model can be streamed, laid out, and verified without a second copy anywhere on
disk:

- the resident weights live in one file with a binary index, so a tensor is one
  `mmap` and one offset, not a safetensors JSON parse;
- the routed experts are split into per-layer files so a decode step touches
  the experts it routed to and nothing else;
- every file is hashed into the manifest and into the receipt, so an install
  that is truncated, swapped, or edited is refused rather than run.

## `manifest.json`

Written by `SSDAIJSON.encodeManifest`. The fields that matter:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `magic`, `versionMajor`, `versionMinor` | `"SSDAI"`, 1, 1. Reads accept 1.0 — an installed manifest is never rewritten, because the receipt binds its digest — and 1.1 is where the extension block below became mandatory (`SSDAIFormatV1.extensionGeometryMandatoryFromMinor`) |
| `modelID` | the model's id, e.g. `"qwen3.5-2b"`. **Not** the API id: the catalog appends the width, giving `qwen3.5-2b_4-Bit` |
| `sourceSnapshotHash` | the source checkpoint's index hash; how an install is traced to what it was built from |
| `arch` | the architecture the planner read. `arch.family` mirrors `ModelFamily` and is what loaders dispatch on |
| `quant` | the five width *slots*, plus one entry per quantified resident tensor (below) |
| `files` | every payload file with its size and sha256 |
| `expertsPerLayer`, `numLayers`, `expertStride` | cross-checked against `packed_experts/layout.json` |
| `flags` | `streamingPresent`, `turboQuantKV`, `aneSharedExpert` |

Conversion-time statistics are not manifest fields. How many per-tensor widths the source checkpoint
declared, for instance, is recorded in the repack audit as `bit_width_overrides_honored`; it never
described these bytes (a MoE install declares dozens of overrides and carries none of them among its
resident tensors), and the manifest is what a reader needs in order to load the payload.

### `quant`: slots **and** per-tensor widths

This is the part that is easy to get wrong, and getting it wrong is silent.

The five slots are `embedding`, `attention`, `router`, `sharedExpert`, and
`routedExpert`, each `{weightBits, scheme, scaleType, biasType, groupSize}`.
They are what the **installer derived** from the tensor data, not what the
source checkpoint declared. A "4-bit" build is 4-bit for the routed experts —
which are almost the whole payload — and can be 8-bit for other tensors.

Concretely, the Qwen 3.5 2B 4-bit checkpoint keeps its embedding and the K/V
projections of its six full-attention layers at 8 bits, which is 13 tensors.
The slots say `attention: 4`. **Both** statements are true, and only the
per-tensor entries say which tensor is which:

```json
"quant": {
  "attention":  { "weightBits": 4, ... },
  "embedding":  { "weightBits": 8, ... },
  "language_model.model.layers.11.self_attn.k_proj": { "weightBits": 8, ... },
  "language_model.model.layers.11.self_attn.v_proj": { "weightBits": 8, ... }
}
```

`weightBits` is the only field a reader consumes per tensor; the rest are
repeated for shape and for a human reading the file. The key is the **stem** —
the resident index name with any `.weight` suffix removed. A reader that trusts
the slots alone unpacks those 8-bit tensors as 4-bit. The word count changes,
the strides still divide evenly, every shape check passes, and the model answers
fluently and wrongly.

Unquantized tensors (norms, scalars) have no entry: they carry no scales, they
are read as BF16 by `dtype`, and they are never dequantized. A stem that lands
on one of the five slot names, or on another tensor's stem at a **different**
width, is refused at install time rather than skipped: one of the two facts
would have to be dropped, and a dropped width is exactly the silent
misread described above.

`routedExpert` is the slot the rest of the system treats as "the model's width":
`ManifestIdentity.weightBits` reads it, and `apiModelID` appends it as
`_<bits>-Bit`, so it is what `/v1/models` shows and what a request names. For a
model that has no routed experts — every dense install — it is set from the
source's base affine width. Left at a default, an 8-bit dense install advertises
itself as 4-bit and the catalog skips it as a duplicate of the real 4-bit one,
which is exactly what happened.

`SSDAIManifestQuantV1` decodes this object by hand. A synthesised `Codable`
would drop the open set of per-tensor keys, because the fixed slots are a
`CodingKeys` enum and the overrides are not — which is exactly the bug that was
shipped and then found by comparing `.ssdai` logits against the snapshot's.

### `arch` extension geometry

Sixteen keys describe the parts of these families that are not in the core
shape: the hyper-connection streams (`hcCount`, `hcLowRank`), the QSA indexer
(`indexerNumHeads`, `indexerNumKVHeads`, `indexerHeadDim`, `indexerBudget`,
`indexerCompressRatio`), the n-gram block (`pleLayerIndices` and its six
scalars), plus `routerNormTopK` and `quantGroupSize`.

They are written **when the architecture has the geometry**, not for one family
name — the writer's old gate was `family == "qwen38flash"`, and the
Qwen3.8-Flash-Next *draft* runs on the target's hyper-connections and indexer,
so it was written with none of them and cross-checked against nothing. The gate
is `hcCount > 0 || indexerBudget > 0 || !pleLayerIndices.isEmpty`, which is how
the runtime defines the same three (`enabled` on each config struct), so writer
and reader agree by construction.

The reader compares every key it is given, and from version 1.1 **requires** the
block for an architecture whose contract has the geometry. A 1.0 manifest may
still omit it, because the installs already on disk were written before the
block was mandatory and no manifest is rewritten in place.


One file, two regions. `indexSize` bytes of index, then `residentSize` bytes of
tensor payload. Both are page-aligned to 16 KB, which is the format's
alignment, not the kernel's.

```
offset 0                                    offset indexSize
+---------------------------+---------------+------------------------------+
|  index                    |  padding      |  resident tensor payload     |
|  header + entries + names |  to 16 KB     |  weights, scales, biases     |
+---------------------------+---------------+------------------------------+
```

`fileOffset`, `scaleOffset` and `biasOffset` in an entry are absolute file
offsets, so they already include `indexSize`. The payload is written in plan
order and packed back to back.

### The index header, 24 bytes

| Offset | Type | Field |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | u64 | `indexSize` |
| 8 | u64 | `residentSize` |
| 16 | u64 | `entryCount` |

`indexSize` includes the header, the entry table, the string table, **and** the
padding to the 16 KB boundary. It is validated as a multiple of 16 KB.

### An index entry, 72 bytes

| Offset | Type | Field |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | u32 | `nameOffset` — **absolute file offset** of the name's UTF-8 bytes |
| 4 | u16 | `nameLen` |
| 6 | u8 | `dtype` |
| 7 | u8 | reserved, 0 |
| 8 | u64 | `fileOffset` — packed weight bytes |
| 16 | u64 | `sizeBytes` |
| 24 | u32 ×4 | `shape[4]`, row-major, padded with zeros |
| 40 | u64 | `scaleOffset` |
| 48 | u64 | `scaleSize` |
| 56 | u64 | `biasOffset` |
| 64 | u64 | `biasSize` |

The string table follows the entry table; a name's offset is **not** relative to
the table. The writer computes `stringTableBase + stringTableOffsets[i]`
(`ResidentWriter.encodeIndex`), where `stringTableBase` is
`24 + entryCount * 72`.

`dtype`:

| Value | Type |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | u32 |
| 1 | bf16 |
| 2 | fp16 |
| 3 | fp32 |

A quantized weight is `dtype 0`: `sizeBytes` covers the packed words and the
group-64 scales and biases are **not entries of their own**. They are reached
through the weight's own `scaleOffset`/`scaleSize`/`biasOffset`/`biasSize`
fields, and they are BF16. This is the sharpest difference from a safetensors
snapshot, which names `foo.scales` and `foo.biases` as separate tensors. Reading
a `.ssdai` index by looking up `"foo.scales"` finds nothing.

### `shape[1]` is the logical width

For a quantized matrix, `shape[1]` in the index is the **logical (unpacked)**
width, not the packed word count that a safetensors header stores for a u32
tensor. A group-64 4-bit tensor with `shape[1] = 2048` holds 2048 logical
columns, `2048 / 64 = 32` scales per row, and `2048 / 8 = 256` packed words per
row. Reading it the snapshot's way makes every matrix two to four times too
wide, and because that only changes how much is read — never whether the read
succeeds — it shows up as a generation that never finishes rather than as an
error.

The scales/biases span is the consistency check that pins it down:
`scaleSize` must be `rows * (columns / groupSize) * 2`, and `biasSize` equal to
it.

### Mapping it

`model_weights.bin` is memory-mapped **once**, for the life of the weights
object, and every tensor is a pointer into that mapping. Mapping per tensor
access re-pages the whole payload on every dequantize; on the 2B that is the
difference between generation that never finishes and generation in about two
seconds. `ResidentWeights` carries the invariant.

## `packed_experts/`

Written by `SSDAIJSON.encodeLayout` and the per-layer writers. `layout.json`
has `expertStride`, `numLayers`, `expertsPerLayer`, and a `layers` array; each
layer has `layer`, `file`, and an `experts` array; each expert has `offset`,
`size`, and a `tensors` object whose keys are `gate`/`up`/`down` with
`_scales`/`_biases` suffixes.

`layer_NN.bin` is a flat array of fixed-stride expert blobs:
`expertsPerLayer * expertStride` bytes, with `expertStride` a multiple of
16 KB. Every expert in a layer has the same stride, so expert `e` starts at
`e * expertStride` and the offsets inside an expert blob are what `layout.json`
records. A decode step reads the nine sub-tensor slices of the experts it
routed to and touches no other file.

### A layer with no routed experts

`expertsPerLayer` is 0 for a model with no MoE layers, and the dense Qwen 3.5
installs are exactly that. `layout.json` still lists a layer per layer, with an
empty `experts` array and a nominal `file` name, because the layer count must
match `manifest.numLayers`. **No `layer_NN.bin` is written**, because its size
would be `0 * expertStride = 0` — 24 empty files to satisfy a check would be
worse than the check. `VerifiedInstallTool.validatePackedExpertLayout` skips a
layer whose expected size is zero and still requires the file when it is not.
`tools/ssdai_diff_snapshot.py` reports this shape directly: 320 resident
tensors, no packed experts.

## `tokenizer/`

`tokenizer.json` is required, and so is `chat_template.jinja` when the model has
a chat template: the OpenAI-compatible server renders ChatML through the
template, and a tokenizer without one cannot serve a chat request. The
`tokenizer/` subdirectory is the canonical location and the only one
`GFTokenizer.tokenizerFolder` looks in. The CPU backend also accepts the files
at the install root and tries that first, because the older dense snapshots were
laid out that way; new installs get the sidecar.

The template, not the family, decides the prompt format, so an install carries
its own. A model with `reasoning` in its template gets thinking mode; effort
levels are resolved per request against the template that is loaded, because the
effort string is baked into the rendered prompt at load time.

## `verified-install.json`

The receipt. It holds `schemaVersion`, `toolVersion`, `verificationTimestamp`,
the source `sourceRevision`, `modelDirectoryPath`, the manifest's own hash, and
the sha256 and size of **every file the install declared** — including
`manifest.json` itself.

`modelDirectoryPath` is what makes the receipt **bound to the absolute path the
install was written to**. Moving or renaming the directory makes the install
fail to load with `trusted receipt invalid: model directory mismatch`. This is
the receipt doing its job: it is what detects a moved or swapped directory. It
is not corruption and does not need a re-download — re-issue it in place, which
re-hashes the payload against the manifest and rebinds it to the current path:

## The manifest must describe the payload, and that is checked

Nothing above is a convention a reader is asked to trust. A packed u32 weight's
byte extent determines its width exactly — a word holds `32 / bits` values, so a
`rows x columns` logical matrix occupies `rows * columns * bits / 8` bytes and
nothing else — which makes the payload the authority and the manifest the thing
that gets checked.

`TinyTitanRepack --verify-install` does that, in
`VerifiedInstallTool.validateQuantAgainstResident`. For every `dtype 0` entry it
computes the implied width from the bytes and requires the width the reader
would resolve to equal it. The reader's rule is reproduced deliberately, because
that rule *is* the contract being verified:

- an explicit per-tensor entry wins;
- otherwise, for an install with no packed experts, `embed_tokens` and `lm_head`
  take the embedding slot and everything else takes the attention slot, exactly
  as `AffineSnapshot.init(ssdai:)` does;
- a packed-expert install keeps its routed-expert widths in
  `packed_experts/layout.json` and its resident tensors are the GPU path's
  business, so no slot fallback is applied and only explicit entries are checked.

With no routed experts the `routedExpert` slot describes no tensor at all, so it
is not derived from anything and is checked separately: it must name a width the
payload actually uses, preferring the dominant one. Ties are resolved as a
*set*, not by picking a maximum, so the verdict cannot depend on dictionary
iteration order. That slot is what `ManifestIdentity.weightBits` reads and what
becomes the `_<bits>-Bit` suffix in `/v1/models`, so a wrong value there is not
cosmetic — it is how an 8-bit install came to advertise itself as 4-bit and get
skipped by the catalog as a duplicate.

This runs before the receipt is written, and a receipt cannot be issued by a run
that failed. Since the runtime validates the receipt and binds it to the
manifest by hash, an install that serves has passed this check — which is why
the runtime does not repeat it.

Both bugs this catches were found by comparing two things that could not both be
true (identical bytes, different logits), not by a check like this one. A
manifest can be internally consistent and still lie about the bytes beside it,
and only a comparison against the payload can see that.

```bash
# From a Hugging Face source, streamed, no full local checkpoint:
swift run -c release TinyTitanRepack --output models/qwen3.6_35B_A3B_4Bit

# From a completed local affine snapshot (how the dense models are built):
swift run -c release TinyTitanRepack --input-snapshot .build/qwen35-2b-affine-4bit \
    --model-id qwen3.5-2b --output models/qwen3.5_2B_4Bit
```

A repack is a **byte copy**, not a re-quantization: the repacker and the dense
converter both use affine group-64, so `RepackPlanner` copies a source `u32
.weight` into the resident payload unchanged. That is what makes the
verification exact:

- `tools/ssdai_diff_snapshot.py <install> <snapshot>` compares every resident
  tensor, weight plus scales plus biases, byte for byte;
- `tests/TinyTitan/CPUEngine/DenseSSDAIEquivalenceTests.swift` loads both and
  requires **identical logits**.

The second is the one that matters. The first proves the bytes are right, which
a wrong per-tensor width would still pass — the bytes are right, they are just
read at the wrong width. `tools/repack_dense.sh` runs both, in that order, then
`--verify-install`.

## Building one

```bash
swift run -c release TinyTitanRepack --verify-install --input-ssdai models/qwen3.5_2B_4Bit
```

Never hand-edit the receipt to match a new path. The binding is the check;
editing it forges the attestation instead of re-establishing it.

Because the receipt is path-bound, an install must be written to where it will
live. Repacking into a temporary directory and moving it into place produces an
install whose receipt is invalid — `tools/repack_dense.sh` repacks straight into
`models/` for this reason.
