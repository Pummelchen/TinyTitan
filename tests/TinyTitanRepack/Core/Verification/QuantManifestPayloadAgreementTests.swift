///     were dequantized as 4-bit -- the model loaded, ran, and talked fluent

///   - `routedExpert` started at a literal 4, so every 8-bit dense install
///     advertised itself as 4-bit and the catalog skipped it as a duplicate of
///     the real 4-bit one: an install that installs, verifies, loads, and
///     cannot be selected.
///
/// The width is not something the manifest has to be trusted for. A u32 packed
/// weight's byte extent determines it exactly, so the payload is the authority.

/// payload (end to end, through a real repack), and that the validator rejects
