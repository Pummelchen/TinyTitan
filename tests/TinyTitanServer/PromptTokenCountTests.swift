/// `POST /v1/messages/count_tokens` promises "the same encoding generation uses,
/// minus the generation", and it was not: it encoded `request.messages` and
/// `request.tools` verbatim while `preparePrompt` applies the CLI strip and then
/// prepends the concise-mode system prompt.
///
/// The two errors point in opposite directions — inflated for the
/// `<model>-fast` alias and whenever `TINYTITAN_STRIP_CLI_PROMPT` is set,
/// under-reported in concise mode — which is why neither showed up as a single
/// suspicious number. A client that budgets or compacts on this number gets it
/// wrong in whichever direction its configuration happens to be.
