///   * **Visible text** passes through the client's stop strings, and each
///     piece that survives is shown to whatever watches the answer -- the
///     watchdogs, on the GPU path. A stop string is a promise about the
///     answer; a model that mentions one while reasoning has not ended it.
///   * **Reasoning** goes straight to the client and is collected apart.
///     Nothing that judges the answer reads it: a model thinking at length
///     before a short reply is working, and the loop and stub detectors were
///     calibrated on answers.
///   * **Tool calls** are collected and forwarded as they are.
