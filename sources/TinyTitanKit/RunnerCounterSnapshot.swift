// Moved out of `ServerCoordinator.swift` (2026-10-02, phase A1 of
// `docs/plan-embedded-library.md`) as a pure declaration move. The orchestrator
// in this target builds the snapshot and diffs it to report this request's
// per-stage deltas; the declaration had been split into the coordinator's file
// only because the two shared `ServerInference.swift` before it was split.
