///     key_w      = groupedRMSNorm(key,     normKey)
///     query      = groupedRMSNorm(streams, normQuery)
///     s[t]       = <key_w[t], query[t]> / sqrt(dim)    // one per stream
///     gate       = sigmoid(sign(s) * sqrt(max(|s|, 1e-6)))
///     gated      = value (x) gate                      // -> streams * dim
///     normalized = groupedRMSNorm(gated, normConv)

///
/// Two details here are silent if wrong, so they are stated rather than

///
/// The convolution carries `(K - 1) * dilation` rows of history across
