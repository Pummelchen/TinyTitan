/// 4B and 9B have twice as many; attention is 8 query heads over 2 KV heads
/// in the 2B and 16 over 4 in the other two. Both ratios are read, never
/// assumed, and the head-sharing tests pin the mapping for each. The 9B also

/// short answer, and a prompt is just decode with the output thrown away.

/// generation slows by 3% when this reads at one thread and by 31% at four.
/// So `threads` is settable, and the caller — which knows whether someone is
/// waiting on the GPU — chooses: one while a client generation is in flight,
