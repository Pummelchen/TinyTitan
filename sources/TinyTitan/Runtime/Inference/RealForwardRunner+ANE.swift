/// Coverage note, stated because the unit run reports this file at 0 covered
/// lines and that number has no meaning without its reason: this is the only
/// body in the runtime whose 0% is not a choice. It runs during a real prefill
/// of a full-attention layer the sidecar covers, so reaching it needs a
/// Qwen3.8-Flash-Next install *and* the exported ANE bundle -- and the
/// installed `.ssdai` here carries none (`manifest.json`, `model_weights.bin`,
/// `ngram_table.bin`, `packed_experts/`, `ple_constants.json`, `tokenizer/`,
/// `verified-install.json`). Producing that bundle is `tools/export_ane_prefill.py`,
/// an operator job, so the right answer is not a test that fetches it.
/// `ANEPrefillAttentionTests` covers the bridge it calls; this method's own
/// staging, rebinding and shadow-append is only observable inside a live
/// prefill, and is reported as not checked rather than as covered.
