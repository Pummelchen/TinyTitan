/// How a family moves data between the residual stream and a sublayer.
///
/// The Qwen3.5-MoE families use plain pre-norm: normalize the residual into a
/// block's input, add the block's output back. Every layer does this twice,
/// once around attention and once around the MLP.
///
/// Qwen3.8-Flash-Next replaces both halves. Its residual is four parallel
/// 2560-wide streams, read through a learned gate that collapses them to one
/// vector and written through another that injects the block's output into
/// every stream with its own weight (`HyperConnection`). The shape of the
/// layer loop is unchanged — still normalize-in, combine-out — so the
/// difference belongs at this seam rather than branching the loop.
///
/// These four call sites are the entire coupling. Keeping them in one file
/// means adding the new family's behaviour touches this file and not the
/// decode or prefill bodies, matching how `TensorSchema` isolates naming.
/// Which sublayer a residual entry/exit pair brackets. A hyper-connection
/// family has separate gate weights for each; a pre-norm family ignores it.
