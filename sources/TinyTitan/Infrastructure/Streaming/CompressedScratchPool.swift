/// demand worker, plus the prefetch ring's.

/// **Why a pool at all.** The first version of the compressed path reused one
/// buffer under a lock. On Ornith 4-bit that put every expert decode in the
/// token behind one mutex and one core, and decode fell from 10.0 to 3.2 tok/s —
/// exactly the single-core LZFSE bound for the ~283 MB a token misses. A
/// per-decode buffer is what lets the misses decode in parallel.
