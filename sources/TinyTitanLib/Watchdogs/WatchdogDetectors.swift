/// the user paid for every token of it.
///
/// The implementation is a rolling hash over a fixed window, so the cost per
/// byte is constant and does not grow with the output (B5). A naive
/// substring search over the accumulated text would be quadratic, and would
/// therefore be slowest on exactly the long generations most in need of
/// watching.
///
/// Three rules keep it honest on ordinary text:
///
///   * repeats must be **far enough apart**. Two windows eight bytes apart
///     are one run of something, not two occurrences of it.
///   * the window must be **varied enough**. A table rule `|---|---|---|`,
///     a line of dashes and a block of indentation all repeat perfectly and
///     none of them is a loop, so a window is only considered once it holds
///     at least twelve distinct bytes -- ordinary English holds around
///     twenty in forty, and so does code.
///   * repeats must fall inside a **recent history**, so a phrase that
///     recurs naturally across a long document (a heading, a variable name)
///     ages out rather than accumulating.
///
/// The thresholds are calibrated, not guessed: `benchmark/watchdog_calibrate.py`
/// runs this over every recorded reply and the count of false positives is
/// asserted to be zero.
