/// arguments until the rounds ran out. None of them needs a model to spot,
/// which is the whole reason they are kept separate from the memory work:
/// no second generation, no extra memory, no dependence on a model's
/// judgement.
///
/// The design rule that matters is that a **detector never decides to stop**.
/// It reports what it saw, and `WatchdogSet` alone turns a report into a
/// stop, and only for the kinds the operator named in `TINYTITAN_WATCHDOG_ACT`.
