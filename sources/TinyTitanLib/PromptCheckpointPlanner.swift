/// produce a prefix of the full render. A checkpoint taken at such a
/// non-prefix would either miss (safe) or, worse, match a prompt it does not
/// describe. Locating `<|im_start|>` in the ids that were actually rendered
/// cannot do that.
///
/// Two points are captured:
///
/// - `systemEnd`: the second message start, when the chat opens with a
///   system/developer message. That is where the first user turn begins, and
///   it survives an edit to any later turn.
/// - `lastTurnStart`: the final message start when the chat ends on a user
///   turn. An edited last turn restores from here instead of re-prefilling the
///   whole conversation.
