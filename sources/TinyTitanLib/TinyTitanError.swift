// The typed errors the embedded engine reports.
//
// Part of the supported facade (phase A1 of `docs/plan-embedded-library.md`,
// §4). A caller fixing a path and a caller waiting for support need to be told
// apart, so the cases are specific rather than one string.
//
// The loader's own `ModelError` is `package` rather than internal, so this
// target can classify it instead of rethrowing an opaque `Error` — which is
// what a load failure used to be. The two cases that carry free text carry the
// loader's wording verbatim, because inventing a digest-shaped value for a
// failure the loader describes in words would be a worse lie than prose.
