// The engine an embedder holds: one install, one Metal device, one resident
// model.
//
// Part of the supported facade (phase A1 of `docs/plan-embedded-library.md`,
// §4). It is a thin, honest layer over the moved orchestrator: loading is
// `ServerModelSession.load`, which is the same path the server takes, and the
// descriptor is read from the install's manifest. No second implementation of
// anything lives here.
//
// Phase A1 gaps, all reported rather than papered over:
//
//   * The loading path builds its own `MetalContext`, which takes the system
//     default device, so the caller's device is honoured only when it is that
//     one; anything else is refused with `metalUnavailable`.
//   * `ServerModelSession.load` derives its streaming mode from the expert
//     cache slot count and resolves its integrity policy from the install, so
//     `EngineConfiguration` cannot expose those two knobs yet.
