/**
 * `dsh-tinytitan/handoff` — continue a task in a fresh context before the
 * session reaches its wall.
 *
 * `autoGoal` keeps one session working; two things still stop it — a turn that
 * ends on `max-tokens`, and a goal blocked because its round cap ran out. With
 * `handoff: true`, this module moves the work to a fresh context *while a turn
 * is running*, which is the only moment the harness lets a plugin do it: the
 * subagent provider runs under an initiating agent whose loop must be active.
 * Measured 2026-10-04 — at `turn/start` it publishes a `fork` child seeded from
 * the parent's history, with our prompt delivered verbatim; at
 * `assistant/message` (which commits after the turn) or `turn/end` it fails with
 * `agent loop is not active`.
 *
 * So the trigger is a budget, judged when a turn opens, against the prompt
 * tokens the previous step reported. The objective moves on before the window
 * fills, and a child that reaches the same budget moves it again. The budget
 * follows the route: with `handoffAtTokens` unset it is `handoffWindowRatio` of
 * the context window the routed model declares, but never within
 * `DEFAULT_HANDOFF_RESERVE_TOKENS` of the window's end — 131,072 on a 256K
 * route (the reserve binds), 600,000 on a 1,000,000-token route and 629,145 on a
 * 1,048,576-token one (the ratio binds) — because "still has room" is a fraction
 * of the route rather than a constant. An explicit `handoffAtTokens` pins one
 * number, and a route whose window cannot be resolved falls back to 120,000.
 *
 * The budget is the normal path; the wall itself is the fallback. A single turn
 * can jump past the window (a huge tool result) and end on `max-tokens`, and the
 * round driver's own disarm for that event leaves no next `turn/start` to hand
 * off from. The driver therefore watches `turn/end` and, when the wall was a
 * context wall (the reported prompt tokens reached the budget) and a hop is
 * still available, re-arms the goal with `goals.resume` — the only lever that
 * creates another turn, because `start` needs a running loop. That is bounded:
 * the disarm must be a context wall, not just an output cap; a hop must be
 * available; and each goal gets at most two re-arms, so a chain that cannot
 * start cannot loop on the wall forever.
 *
 * ## What a hop actually does
 *
 * Measured on a live run (2026-10-04), a forked child inherits the parent's
 * `goal/change` events — but *not* its activation, because activation is
 * process-local and never persisted (`GoalView.activation` is documented as
 * "process-local continuation eligibility"). The child therefore starts with the
 * same objective **disarmed**, its round driver queues nothing, and the hop
 * would buy exactly one turn. A handoff is only useful if it moves the work, so
 * one hop does three things atomically from the plugin's side:
 *
 * 1. disarms the handing-off session, which stops its rounds after the turn
 *    already in flight (otherwise the parent and every child would work the same
 *    objective in parallel);
 * 2. arms the child's inherited goal, so the child's own round driver continues
 *    the objective there;
 * 3. holds the child while its goal is actively continuing and releases it once
 *    that stops — completed, blocked, disarmed, or handed on further. The release
 *    rule is not "when the run settles": a fork child is a **one-shot** run whose
 *    `result` resolves at the end of its prompt turn, and disposing there (the
 *    first version did) killed the child before its round driver could queue the
 *    continuation, so a hop bought exactly one turn. The child is therefore
 *    released only at **idle**, and only when its goal is no longer active and
 *    armed. That also keeps a finished child from holding the app open — a
 *    headless run hung for its full timeout before any release rule existed.
 *
 * A hop that never starts rolls its claim back, so a refused start does not
 * spend the objective's budget.
 *
 * ## Why the hop count is keyed on the goal
 *
 * The first version keyed it on the child session and recorded it only after
 * `start()` resolved. A child's opening turn races that write, so every child
 * read "hop 1" and a zero budget forked until the process aborted (100+
 * sessions, SIGABRT). The count is therefore keyed on the **goal id** — one
 * identity that survives the fork seed — and the hop is **claimed before** the
 * await: the guard is a property of the work, not of a session that does not
 * exist yet. An in-flight set stops two triggers for the same goal starting two
 * children, and a live-children cap bounds the whole process.
 *
 * What this deliberately is **not**:
 *
 * - **Not a successor root session.** The successor is a child session: real,
 *   with its own log and context, but not one you steer like a new chat.
 * - **Not unbounded.** `handoffHops` caps the chain per goal, `0` is not a legal
 *   budget, `handoffMaxChildren` caps live children, and every hop is logged.
 * - **Not a way around a real blocker.** A goal the model blocked stays blocked;
 *   only an active, armed goal is handed on.
 *
 * A missing service, provider or live agent is a logged no-op.

     * `max-tokens` — and that disarm (the round driver's own, on this event)

     * reached the budget, not just the output cap), a hop must actually be
     * available, and each goal gets at most two attempts — otherwise a chain
     * that cannot start would loop on the wall forever.
