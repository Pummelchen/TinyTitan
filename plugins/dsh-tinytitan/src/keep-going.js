/**
 * `dsh-tinytitan/keep-going` — an ordinary manual prompt runs to completion.
 *
 * The harness already owns the machinery: `@deepseek-ai/dsh-goal` keeps one
 * long-running objective per session, `@deepseek-ai/dsh-goal-round-driver`
 * queues the next round while the agent is idle and the goal is armed, and
 * `@deepseek-ai/dsh-tool-goal` lets the model complete or block that goal. What
 * a person does not get for free is the *start*: they either type `/goal …`, or
 * the model has to decide the request is goal-shaped.
 *
 * This module adds the third way, for a profile that asks for it. With
 * `autoGoal: true`, a direct human message that arrives while no unfinished goal
 * is current creates and arms one whose objective is that message. Nothing else
 * is reproduced here — no rounds are scheduled, no completion is judged, no
 * session is spawned — so the behaviour is exactly `/goal <that message>`, and
 * every rule the harness already applies (round cap, blocking policy, authority
 * checks, arming rules after resume or fork) still applies to it.
 *
 * Two consequences worth knowing before turning it on:
 *
 * - **Every** manual prompt becomes a goal, including a question a person meant
 *   as a chat turn. The model is told to continue until it judges the goal
 *   complete, so it answers and then calls `update_goal ... complete`; a model
 *   that instead keeps working spends rounds from the cap below.
 * - Completion needs `@deepseek-ai/dsh-tool-goal` mounted; the shipped standard
 *   composition mounts it, and a deployment that does not would run an
 *   auto-created goal into its round cap instead of letting the model finish it.
 *
 * A missing goal service is not an error: the switch stays a no-op and the
 * reason is logged once, because a harness composed without goals must boot
 * exactly as it did before this option existed.
 *
