/**
 * The one harness release this plugin supports, and how the running one is read.
 *
 * A harness upgrade is not cosmetic here. This plugin generates an agent preset
 * from the *shipped* `standard` composition, so its row ids and the way presets
 * are declared move under it — 0.2.0-rc.2 is the release that replaced the
 * harness-home `agent.cordis.yml` presets (and `@deepseek-ai/dsh-agent-presets`)
 * with `@deepseek-ai/dsh-agent-preset` rows registered through the
 * `agentPresets` service — and it mounts a compaction backend that subclasses
 * `dsh-compaction-basic`, so that engine's internals move under it too.
 *
 * The supported range is therefore a single release. Older ones, later ones and
 * a harness built from `main` are out of support deliberately, not assumed to
 * work. `test/support.test.js` asserts {@link SUPPORTED_DSH_VERSION} against the
 * two places that cannot import it — this package's `peerDependencies` and the
 * launcher's pin in `tools/dsh_local.sh` — so widening one without the others
 * fails the suite.
 *
 * Detection is best-effort and answers `null` when it cannot tell, which
 * {@link supportDecision} reads as a refusal rather than as permission: this
 * plugin writes into the harness home, so an unreadable version is not a reason
 * to proceed.
 *

 * a version we can read as different and a version we cannot read at all are a
 * refusal: failing closed is the only answer that keeps "supports
 * `0.1.6-alpha.2`" a statement about the product rather than about our luck.
 *
 * A refusal is a **return, never a throw**. This plugin mounts into somebody
 * else's profile, so the harness must boot, every other plugin must load, and
 * removing this one must leave a working installation with nothing to undo. The
 * refusal is reported through the host logger, which is why it is a decision
 * object rather than an exception: the caller reports and returns.
 *
 * @param version - a version from {@link dshVersion}.
 * @param supported - the supported release, for tests.
